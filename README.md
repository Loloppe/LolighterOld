**Light?** This program use "_notes" "_time" from your .dat file to generate "_events" corresponding to your Beatmap. A new file called "ExpertPlusStandard.dat" will be created in the same location of the program. Color swap speed: The color swap between blue and red every X beat (default 4). Color swap offset: Where the first color should start (default first note + 0). Use Strobe: Unticking this will remove all the "Off" events. Use Fade: Unticking this will change all "Fade" into "On" events. Spin/Zoom: Unticking this will remove all "Spin" and "Zoom" events. Spin Speed: Range allowed for the randomizer to pick from during left/right laser placement.

**Sliders?** Convert most notes into sliders. Limiter: Minimum distance required between notes of the same color, or ignored. Checkbox: Untick to allow "Loloppe notes" to be slidified, can cause issue.

**Inverted?** Invert most notes while keeping the exact same flow. Limiter: Minimum distance required between notes of the same color, or ignored. Checkbox: Untick to allow "Loloppe notes" to be inverted, can cause issue.

**Bomb?** Add bombs around notes.

**Loloppe?** Add additional note around notes.

**Downscaler?** Remove stacks, windows, sliders, tower. Flatten map. Downmap. Redo the flow.
